# Text File Word Counter
This program provides the shell of a word count application for text files. 
There's no user interface (yet) but it contains methods that:

1.  Open an input file for reading.

2.  Read all the words from the file, count the number of times each
    word occurs and records this data to a vector.

3.  Sort the vector

4.  Write the sorted vector to an output file.


The files in the 'data' folder are examples of what this program can input and output.
